      <h1>Hi, visitor!</h1>
      <p>If you've landed on this page, then you're probably interested in learning more about me.</p>
      <p>My name is <b>David Fronder</b>. If anything, this is just my nickname. I am 17 years old and a high school student.</p>
      <p>I don't have just one hobby; considering how unstable I am, my interests change often.</p>
      <p>I do enjoy writing, though. I write regularly on Medium and on my Telegram channel.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy programming, partly to maintain and develop this site. I like physics and math, although I have found the latter difficult in recent years.</p>
      <p>I also like anime, manga, and Japan in general. I study Japanese in hopes of visiting this beautiful country one day.</p>
      <p>I speak English and Russian. I love history and politics, though I don't fully understand these subjects. I am an amateur photographer.</p>
      <p>I am strange and sometimes irascible, but I am an interesting person to talk to if you are a good conversationalist.</p>
      <p>You can find more information on my blogs and resources.</p>
      <p>I hope you found this information helpful, and I hope we can become friends!</p>
      <p><b>Peace!</b></p>
